Beyondskins HTML5 theme for Plone
=================


This is a very basic and clean Plone theme that uses HTML5 tags in your structure and gives you a Semantic HTML to start your projects.

HTML
-------------------------

Instead a lot of `div>`tags, this theme uses new HTML5 tags like `header> section> <nav> and <footer>`

Styles
-------------------------

**CSS Reset**

Beyondskins HTML5 use [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to reset the styles. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

**Grid**

Beyondskins HTML5 doesn't use any grid system, mainly becouse the actual grid systens make a mess in your html, adding a lot of non semantical tags. And becouse you don't need a grid system to create a website with 2 or 3 columns.

To change columns size, just edit grid.css file included ins this package:

    #main {width: 100%;}
    #main-content {width: auto;}
    #column-one {width: 16%;}
    #column-two {width: 30%;}

If you need a grid system, just plug your favorite grid system folowing their instructions. With a littlo mess in the HTML file you can make any modern grid system to work here.
